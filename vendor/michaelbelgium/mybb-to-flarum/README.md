## Important notes
* If u specify u want to migrate avatars then a path to your <u>MyBB forum is required also.</u>
* Forums with a redirect hyperlink are skipped. Flarum doesn't support them (yet).
* A guest who created a MyBB post or thread will appear as a deleted user in Flarum and not specifically a "guest".
* The core BBcode extension should be enabled too.
